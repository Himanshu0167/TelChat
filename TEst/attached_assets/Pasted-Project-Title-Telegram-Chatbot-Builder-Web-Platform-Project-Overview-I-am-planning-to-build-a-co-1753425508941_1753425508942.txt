Project Title: Telegram Chatbot Builder Web Platform

Project Overview:

I am planning to build a complete web-based platform that allows users to create and manage their own Telegram chatbots without writing code. The core functionality is inspired by Telegram bots like @MenuBuilderBot, enabling users to define menu-based bots with custom replies.

The website will be developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Core PHP (no backend frameworks). MySQL will be used as the database. The structure should be clean, modular, and well-organized, following best practices for file and code organization. While backend frameworks are avoided, you are free to use modern UI/UX libraries or frameworks (like Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, or others) to give the interface a sleek, responsive, and user-friendly design.

Key Features:

User Authentication:

Simple, secure Login/Register system using PHP sessions and hashed passwords.

Forgot password / Reset password (optional, but recommended).

User Dashboard:

A central place for users to view, manage, or delete their bots.

Option to add new Telegram bots.

View status (active/inactive) and analytics like number of users interacting with the bot.

Telegram Bot Integration:

Users will provide their BotFather token and a custom name.

Automatically setup the webhook and perform basic validation.

After setup, redirect the user to a bot editor page.

Bot Builder (Menu Editor):

Graphical interface to define custom menus, commands, and responses.

Create hierarchical menus like: Main Menu -> Sub Menu -> Final Response.

Each button can trigger text, image, or multimedia reply.

Backend stores this structure in a structured format in the database.

Bot Customization Panel:

Upload and manage:

Bot profile picture.

Bot description and about section.

Additional info like category, language preferences, etc.

Telegram Interaction API:

Backend script to receive Telegram webhook events and respond based on user-defined menus.

Secure communication with Telegram’s API using cURL and token authentication.

Bonus Suggestions (for a more robust product):

Activity Logs: Show last interaction logs with timestamps for each bot.

Templates: Provide pre-made bot structures for quick deployment.

Multilingual UI Support: Let users choose interface language (even Hindi, etc.).

Dark Mode Toggle: Improve UX with light/dark theme switching.

Bot Preview Tool: Simulate bot interaction on the website before deploying.

Development Notes:

All code must be written from scratch using core PHP—no Laravel, CodeIgniter, etc.

UI can be enhanced using Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, FontAwesome, jQuery, etc.

Ensure security best practices are followed: input validation, prepared statements, session handling.

Database schema should be designed to allow future scalability (like supporting multiple bot types).
